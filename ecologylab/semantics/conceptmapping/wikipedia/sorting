sorting of the generated inlinks & surfaces files:

- why

to index target concepts being linked by other concepts, or surfaces linking to different concepts.

- when

after the inlinks & surfaces files are generated, before the recognition of common concepts and
surfaces.

- how

using the standard *nix utility 'sort':

    $ sort -f -o <output> -S 512M -T . <input>
    
512M is the buffer size; it should adapt to the machine's physical memory. it will sort the input
file to the output file using external sorting. several temporal files will be generated in current
directory.
